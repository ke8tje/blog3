Weak signal propergating reporter (WSPR) is a low power digital protocol that can be used measure propergation. This can also be used to evaluate your antenna's performance. The classic way to setup WSPR requires having a computer and running WSJT-X. This setup however requires you to have a computer and a compatible radio.

 In most of my use cases (POTA,SOTA) a computer is a luxcuary that I don't have out in the field. I wanted to build a standalone beacon that will use a GPS to update the location and time and send out WSPR data.

## Building and testing

Using off the sheld conponent a GPS, an Arduino Uno and a Si 5351A clock generator chip, I was able to make a prototype easily. Using opensource code I was able to get a basic version running relatively easily. 

After borrowing some design elements from the trUSDX schematic for a simple amplifier(one of the coolest application I have seen for a digital logic IC) and a filter I was able to clean up the output signal considarably.


## Testing and final design

You can find a simple PCB and the code used for this in github here. Paring up the PCB with a lipo battery and a 3D printed case I finally have a 20m stand alone WSPR beacon I can test antenna systems/propergation any time any where by simply connecting to an antenna.
